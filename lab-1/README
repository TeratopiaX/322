Redid code so that both the parent and the child must use the same function to report its process information.

Looked at the lab requirement doc for the first time. Checked that code uses OTBS spacing and is formatted correctly. 

unsure whether indentation is 2 spaces or 4 spaces. my personal preference is 2 but I will indent my code to be 4 spaces to be safe. 

Also, I have never seen READ.me ever and don't understand that extension. I have only seen README or README.txt
